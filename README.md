## 🎯 Development Guidelines

### Code Standards

- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled, no `any` types allowed
- **React**: Functional components with TypeScript interfaces
- **Styling**: Component-scoped CSS with kebab-case class names
- **Commits**: Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format

### Architecture Principles

- **Feature-First Organization**: Code organized by domain/feature rather than file type
- **Single Source of Truth**: Student data managed centrally through SchaleDB integration
- **Performance Focused**: Lazy loading, virtualization, and optimized assets
- **Community Driven**: Clean, documented code for easy contributions

### Data Management

Student data is fetched from SchaleDB and cached locally. The data includes:
- Basic student information (name, school, role)
- Detailed stats and skills
- Character artwork and portraits
- Equipment and weapon data
